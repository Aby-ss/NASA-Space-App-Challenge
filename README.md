## Introduction
Welcome to our project developed for the NASA Space App Challenge, where we've harnessed the power of the Unity game engine to create an immersive and educational gaming experience. Our mission is to make learning about eclipses in space an engaging and interactive adventure, all while keeping you on the edge of your seat with captivating storytelling.

## About the Project
Our project, which we'll simply refer to as [Game Name], combines cutting-edge game development with space science education. At its core, it's a 2D game that transports players into the vast expanse of space, where they embark on a thrilling journey to explore eclipses. 

Utilizing the Unity game engine, we've crafted a visually stunning and highly interactive experience. You'll find no shortage of engaging content and educational value throughout your gameplay. Instead of a traditional lecture-style learning approach, we've seamlessly integrated educational elements into the gameplay itself.

## Gameplay and Educational Focus
[Game Name] offers an innovative approach to educating players about eclipses. It combines the thrill of space exploration with the depth of scientific knowledge. As you navigate your spacecraft through the cosmos, you'll encounter various types of eclipses. Each eclipse presents a unique challenge that not only tests your gaming skills but also deepens your understanding of these celestial events.

Our storytelling approach is a key highlight of the game. As you progress through [Game Name], you'll be immersed in a captivating narrative that unfolds with each eclipse witnessed. This narrative thread ties the gameplay together, making the learning experience engaging and meaningful.

Furthermore, the game offers detailed explanations and information about the different types of eclipses, how they occur, and their significance in the field of space science. We believe that by making education an integral part of the gameplay, we can inspire a greater interest in astronomy and space exploration.

## Installation and Compatibility
Installing [Game Name] is a straightforward process:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/[game-repo]).
